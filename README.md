<b>README:</b>
This was my first freelance project to practice the skills I learned in Code Louisville.

<b>DISCLAIMER<b>This site is not affiliated with any medical facility and is only used as a reference guide for monitor techs. 

<b>Features:</b>
This project was originally built with a mobile first approach. However upon client request- was updated to be mobile only. 

Some of the features of this site is the user-friendly navigation and well-organized content to make it easier for the user to interact with and understand the content.

Another feature is a reference guide (flip cards) to help the user quickly and easily identify arrhythmias based on characteristics for that arrhythmia.

There is a Heart-rate and QT calculator with the formulas highlighted so the user can calculate a patient's heart rate with the R-R interval, and correct for heart-rate with the QT calculator using Bazet's formula.

A built-in quiz keeps track of a user's score and tests their knowledge in reading EKGs.

Lastly a guide to our policies and a checklist or responsibilities is included to aid new hires fresh off orientation.
