    </button>
  </div>  
  
      <p>The monitor-tech is responsible for keeping track of a number of devices. The devices must be signed out 
        by the person retreiving them. They should include the patient name, room number, date & time, and device number if applicable, 
        as well as the name of the person retriving the device. Below are the devices the monitor-tech is responsible for tracking. 
        (Note that these devices are stored in the telemetry room.)</p>

      <h1 id= "censusChecking">Census Checking</h1>
        <p>It is important to check the census regularly to ensure that there are no conflicts with patient data. 
            This involves comparing each sector with what is listed in Epic. In addition to checking your census, 
            there is also another list that must be checked. The monitor-tech list is a list of patients that each 
            have a telemetry order in.</p>

            <h2>Telemetry Order Sets</h2>
            <p>Whenever a physician enters a telemetry order for a patientâ€“ that patients name ends up on the 
              monitor-tech list. This list is to ensure that all patients that need to be followed and reviewed dont 
              get missed due to human error. 
          </p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h1 id= "reviews">Reviews:</h1>
    <p>A twelve hour review is done per patient with telemetry orders. 
      The review is broken down into three sections. So you will end up doing three four hour reviews per shift.
      During your review it is your job to document what you see and the frequency in certain arrythmia. 
      This includes changes in patient rhythm and real alarms. </p>

    <ul class= "list">
       <li>Dayshift Review times are 0800, 1200 & 1600.</li>
       <li>NightShift Review times are 1600, 2000 & 0400.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 id= "alarmFiltering">Alarm Filtering:</h1>
    <p>During each review you will start with going through the alarms of each patient that has telemetry orders.
      You are responsibile for filtering through the alarms and only deleting artifact or duplicate alarms. </p>
     
      <p>It is important that you know how to tell the difference between artifact versus real. During your telemtry training 
      you will learn to do exactly that! Once you have finished going through the alarms, it is time to review. 
   </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1 id= "alarmManagement">Alarm Management:</h1>
      
        <p>Part of alarm management is making sure that each patients waves are clear with no baseline artifact. You can optimize 
          the waves shown by sizing up or down and even change the primary & secondary waveforms. Doing this will prevent artifact 
          alarms before they happen- which will save you time when filtering & prevent alarm fatigue.</p> 
          
          <p>Another part of alarm management is knowing the parameters per patient age. If the parameters are not set appropriatly per patients age they may alarm
          incessantly and needlessly. You can call the RN taking care of the patient to verify alarm parameters before changing.</p>
      
          <p>If a patient is alarming frequently, and the parameters are set appropriatly- you can also call the RN taking care of the patient
          to verify if there is a concern for this patient- if there is no concern you can inquire about changing the alarm parameters. The
          RN will have to consult with the doctors before the parameters can be changed to decrease alarms.

                <p> Control strips can be saved for every patient per monitor easily by clicking this icon in
                   the top right corner & following the prompts.</p>
              </div> 
          </div>
          </div>
            <p>Strips are saved at specific times throughout the day & night, these are known as control strips. Control strips are done at 
              on dayshift at 1400-(2:00), and nightshift at 2200-(10:00) and 0600-(6:00). </p>
              
              <p>The control strips along with the strips you save throughout your review- the strips that show changes in patients rhythm are then printed out on nightshift and
              assembled into telemetry reports for the physicians to review.</p>

          <section>
            <h1 id= "techSupport">Tech Support:</h1>
            <p>Throughout your shift you my be contacted by nurses requiring technical support. You will learn more about trouble-shooting for 
              common technical issues in the technical support tab at the top of the page.

            <h1 id= "alert">Alerting & Documenting:</h1>
            <p>You are expected to alert the nurse caring for the patient of any changes you see throughout your review as well as any real alarms
              that come across in real time. Everyone is responsibile for the alarms. If an monitor is alarming for specified amount of time, contact 
              the RN caring for that patient. Make sure to document the phone calls you make- with the name of the R.N you spoke with, 
                date & time on the back of your review packet.

            <h1 id= "graphicTrends">Graphic Trends:</h1>
            <p><strong>(NIGHT-SHIFT ONLY)</strong> Around 0335 a text needs to be sent to the RNs of patients with telemetry orders to remind them to print their trends.

              </section>
          
          <section>

      <h1 id= "reports">Reports:</h1>
        <p><strong>(NIGHT-SHIFT ONLY)</strong> is responsibile for printing all the strips that have been saved throughout the day and night and assembiling 
          the strips as well as the trends in telemetry reports. These reports go in the respective bins. After the cardiologists review 
          and sign the reports they are then tubed to the correct floors. The ancillary staff on those floors then place the reports in 
          the scanning bin for medical records to pick up. Next they are scanned into each patients chart and then returned to their respective floors.
          It is important for you to understand this process.

        <section>
        <h1 id= "orders">Order-Sets: WOI & ULP</h1>
        <p>WOI stands for Without Interpretation, and it simply means that the monitor tech stay alert for any changes in patient 
          rhythm. If you notice a change alert the nurse caring for the patient. In addition if a patient has WOI orders then you need to ensure that 
          the patient data is displayed on the central monitor, this would entail pulling up the patient sector if the patient is located on a med/surg floor 
          or NICU. This is because only patient data for all CICU, PICU & PCU rooms are continuously displayed.
          Note: Sometimes patients that are WOI will be changed to ULP if the physicians decide their strips need cardiology interpretation.</p>
      
            <p>ULP stands for University of Louisville physicians and this order means the patient is followed by cardiology and will also be reviewed by 
              the monitor tech. If the Monitor tech finds any arrythmias they will communicate them with the nurse who will then pass along the 
              information to the physicians. Cardiology will review the reports we prepare for them in the morning. However if a patient is declining and there
              is concern or uncertainity of a rhythm a patient is either sustaining or going in & out of -cardiology may be contacted at any time 
              to consult on the strips.
